            <h3>Bio</h3>
                <div class="info">
                    <p>
                        Charlie is an easily excitable man-child who is unable to cope with daily problems, prone to emotional outbursts and is often confused and flabbergasted by modern-day life. His anger management issues, substance abuse, poor hygiene, lack of common sense, and a poor grasp of reality tends to prevent him from ever achieving much success in life, and he instead lives in squalor. He frequently abuses inhalants such as glue, spray paint and poppers and, like the rest of the Gang, is a heavy drinker. He also frequently eats cat food before bed, to induce a feeling of sickness that allows him to fall asleep rapidly.

                    <p>
                        Charlie's difficulty reading and writing, generally poor communication skills, and poor grasp of grammar and syntax result in constant berating by the rest of the Gang. He is unable to read or write correctly, and keeps a personal journal consisting predominantly of childlike pictures in place of actual sentences. It is quite possible that Charlie has a lifelong case of severe, untreated dyslexia.

                    <p>
                        Charlie is, however, something of a savant, displaying natural talent as a pianist, music composer, playwright, choreographer, tailor, and hockey player. He is also very capable of devising intricate, Machiavellian schemes.
